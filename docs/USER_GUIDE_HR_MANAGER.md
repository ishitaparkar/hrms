## Menu Structure

The sidebar menu has been reorganized to provide clearer separation between personal items and employee management functions.

### New Menu Organization

#### For HR Manager Role:

```
📊 Admin Dashboard
📋 Requirement Raising
👥 Recruitment
📝 Notes & Approvals

👤 My Space (Personal Items)
   ├── 👤 Profile
   ├── 💰 Payroll
   ├── 🏢 Assets
   ├── 📅 Attendance
   ├── 🌴 Leaves
   ├── ⏱️ Time Tracker
   └── ⭐ Performance

🏢 Employee Management
   ├── 📋 Staff Directory
   └── ➕ Add New Staff

📢 Announcement
📤 Resignation Management
```

### What Changed?

**Before:**
- "Employee" dropdown contained both personal items and management functions
- "Admin Account" and "My Profile" were separate menu items
- Confusing mix of personal and management functions

**After:**
- **"My Space"** dropdown contains all personal items (your own data)
- **"Employee Management"** dropdown contains staff management functions
- Single unified **"Profile"** menu item (no more confusion!)
